# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The project entailed creating a webpage based on UFO sightings which contains a dynamic table.
### Purpose
This project aims to expand the dynamic table by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria. By using both JavaScript and HTML, the project added the following filters: city, state, country, and shape. The end-users will have the capacity to update the webpage with the search criteria. 
## Results
### Listed below are steps and images to perform UFO sighting searches: 

The top of the web application displays the title as a jumbotron.

In the middle of the page, is a brief synopsis from an Ufologist.

Displayed below is the application for filters and the steps on how to execute a search. 

1.	Enter the date in the given format (mm/dd/yyyy).

2.	Enter a city, however, “Enter a City” does not require a date in “Enter Date” field.

3.	Filtering the State and Country is another feature.

4.	The last filter is shape. 

None of the filters are dependent on each other and users may search separately or complete all the fields. 
## Summary
### Drawback:
- One drawback of this webpage is the lower-case sensitivity when filtering the search. If the user doesn’t type in lower case, the filter will not respond, and no results will be given. 
### Recommendations:
- Based on the drawback above, allow for both upper and lower cases in the filter search.
- Add a drop-down menu for both Country and shape in the filter search.
- Clear button near the filter search should be added for the ease of the user.
